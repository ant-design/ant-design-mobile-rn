`SegmentedControl` includes at least two segments, it is used to display diffrent views and recommended by `iOS`.

### Rule
- It is similar to the functionality used for `Tabs`, so avoid to use them at same page as much as possible.
- You can use `SegmentedControl` with `NavBar` to display mutiple views.
- Generally there should be no more than 5 segments in one line, each segment has 2-4 words and needs simplified texts.
- Keep the length of the text consistent as much as possible.
