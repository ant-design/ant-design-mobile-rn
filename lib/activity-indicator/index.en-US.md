`ActivityIndicator` indicates that a task is currently in progress.

### Rules
- Don't stop activity indicator if the task is not completed.
- By providing meaningful texts under certain circumstances can help user understand which task is in progress. eg: uploading photos.
- If you know the user's waiting time, you can use `Progress` instead.
