## FAQ

### On the Android platform, when using `Carousel` nested in `ScrollView`, the Carousel Item cannot slide. What should I do?

Support in `5.1.3`. Set the `nestedScrollEnabled` property of `ScrollView` to `true`.

```jsx
<ScrollView nestedScrollEnabled={true}>
  ...
  <Carousel vertical/>
</ScrollView>
```

### Why choose Carousel instead of `react-native-pager-view` ?

First, Carousel supports the `infinite` property, which means 🌟a true infinite loop🌟. <br/>
Second, Carousel is completely based on `ScrollView`, which is not only lighter but also more compatible.
