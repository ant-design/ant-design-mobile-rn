## Version

- Stable: [![npm package](http://img.shields.io/npm/v/@ant-design/react-native.svg?style=flat-square)](http://npmjs.com/package/@ant-design/react-native)
- Next: [![npm package](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@ant-design/react-native/next.svg)](http://npmjs.com/package/@ant-design/react-native)

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install @ant-design/react-native @ant-design/icons-react-native
```

### Installing peer dependencies
We manage the following dependencies through `peerDependencies` to allow you to choose versions more flexibly and reduce repeated installation of dependencies:

 - If you have an Expo managed project, install the dependencies with `expo`:
   ```bash
   npx expo install react-native-gesture-handler react-native-reanimated
   ```

 - If you have a bare React Native project, install the dependencies with `npm`:
   ```bash
   npm install react-native-gesture-handler react-native-reanimated
   ```

### Link icon fonts

 - Add assets to your `react-native.config.js` ( If not exist, please create in projectâ€™s root directory ):

   ```js
   module.exports = {
     assets: ['node_modules/@ant-design/icons-react-native/fonts'],
   };
   ```

 - Run the [react-native-asset](https://github.com/unimonkiez/react-native-asset)'s command and linking + unlinking is automatic:

   ```bash
   npx react-native-asset
   ```

 - If you have an Expo managed project, skip the previous two steps and use [expo-font](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/font/) to load the font directly:
   ```jsx
   import { useFonts } from 'expo-font';

   const [fontsLoaded] = useFonts({
    antoutline: require('@ant-design/icons-react-native/fonts/antoutline.ttf'),
  })
   ```

## Usage

Example of usage:

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { AppRegistry } from 'react-native';
import Button from '@ant-design/react-native/lib/button';

class HelloWorldApp extends Component {
  render() {
    return <Button>Start</Button>;
  }
}

AppRegistry.registerComponent('HelloWorldApp', () => HelloWorldApp);
```

**If you need to use `Modal` and `Toast` you also need to add `Provider` to the app entry point**

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { AppRegistry } from 'react-native';
import { Button, Provider, Toast } from '@ant-design/react-native';

class HelloWorldApp extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <Provider>
        <Button onPress={() => Toast.info('This is a toast tips')}>
          Start
        </Button>
      </Provider>
    );
  }
}
```

##### Use modularized @ant-design/react-native

The following two ways used to load the **only components you used**, select one of the ways you like.

- Use [babel-plugin-import](https://github.com/ant-design/babel-plugin-import) (Recommended)

  ```js
  // .babelrc or babel-loader option
  {
    "plugins": [
      ["import", { libraryName: "@ant-design/react-native" }] // The difference with the Web platform is that you do not need to set the style
    ]
  }
  ```

  Then just change the way of import modules from @ant-design/react-native.

  ```jsx
  import { Button } from '@ant-design/react-native';
  ```

  > Note: Some people reflected that it would be [unable to resolve module `react-dom`](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design-mobile/issues/2054) in a project created with `react-native init`. If you encounter the same problem, you might try to install [babel-plugin-module-resolver](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-module-resolver).

- Manually import

  ```jsx
  import Button from '@ant-design/react-native/lib/button';
  ```

##### More enhanced (optional):
