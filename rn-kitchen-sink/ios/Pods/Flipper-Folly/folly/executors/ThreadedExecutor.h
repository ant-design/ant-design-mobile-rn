/***
 *  ThreadedExecutor
 *
 *  An executor for blocking tasks.
 *
 *  This executor runs each task in its own thread. It works well for tasks
 *  which mostly sleep, but works poorly for tasks which mostly compute.
 *
 *  For each task given to the executor with `add`, the executor spawns a new
 *  thread for that task, runs the task in that thread, and joins the thread
 *  after the task has completed.
 *
 *  Spawning and joining task threads are done in the executor's internal
 *  control thread. Calls to `add` put the tasks to be run into a queue, where
 *  the control thread will find them.
 *
 *  There is currently no limitation on, or throttling of, concurrency.
 *
 *  This executor is not currently optimized for performance. For example, it
 *  makes no attempt to re-use task threads. Rather, it exists primarily to
 *  offload sleep-heavy tasks from the CPU executor, where they might otherwise
 *  be run.
